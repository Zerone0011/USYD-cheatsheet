# USYD-cheatsheet/Notes 📚🎓

Hello there! This repository contains the cheatsheets/notes I created during my master’s studies at USYD. These materials were incredibly helpful for my final exams, and I hope they can be just as useful to anyone else who needs them.

## Overview 🚀
- Each cheatsheet took a significant amount of time to put together.
- The primary references were the unit PowerPoint slides.
- I also consulted various other sources, but I’m sorry I can’t list them here (I’ve forgotten where some were from).
